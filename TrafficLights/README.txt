THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO SIMULATE A TRAFFIC INTERSECTION. IT 
RANDOMLY GENERATES CARS AND PEDESTRIANS TO APPROACH THE INTERSECTION
FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS WHERE THEY WILL ACTIVATE A PRESSURE PLATE
OR A PEDESTRIAN BUTTON, WHICH IS USED TO CHANGE THE LIGHTS AT A
USER SPECIFIED INTERVAL. MY NEXT PLAN IS TO IMPLEMENT LEFT TURN
LANES AND ARROWS TO INCREASE THE COMPLEXITY OF THE LIGHT INTERACTIONS.
